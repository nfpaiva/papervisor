# README - Sample PDF Files for Demo Project

This directory contains sample PDF placeholders for the demo project. In a real implementation, these would be actual PDF files downloaded automatically or uploaded manually.

## Automatic Downloads (pdfs/automatic/)
- chen_2023_realtime_ai_decisions.pdf (placeholder)
- martinez_2022_optimization_review.pdf (placeholder)
- zhang_2021_resource_allocation.pdf (placeholder)
- kumar_2023_agent_scheduling_drl.pdf (placeholder)
- brown_2020_ai_survey.pdf (placeholder)

## Manual Uploads (pdfs/manual/)
- additional_reference_paper.pdf (placeholder)
- industry_report_contact_centers.pdf (placeholder)

## Extracted Texts (pdfs/extracted_texts/)
These files contain the actual extracted and processed text content from the PDFs above.

For the demo project, text extraction has been simulated with realistic academic content including:
- Proper citation formats
- Academic section structure
- Mathematical formulations
- Tables and figures metadata
- Extraction quality metrics

## Notes
- In production, PDF files would be automatically downloaded using DOI links
- Manual uploads support researcher-added references
- Text extraction would be performed using tools like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or commercial APIs
- Extraction metadata helps track processing quality and troubleshoot issues
