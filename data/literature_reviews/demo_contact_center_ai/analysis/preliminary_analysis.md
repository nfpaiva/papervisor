## 8. Methodology Notes

### Analysis Approach
- **Automated Processing:** Basic statistics and counts
- **Manual Review:** Thematic analysis and quality assessment
- **Validation:** Cross-reference with extracted text content
- **Bias Considerations:** Limited to English-language publications

### Limitations
- **Demo Dataset:** Simulated data may not reflect actual research patterns
- **Small Sample:** 32 papers insufficient for robust statistical analysis
- **Single Domain:** Contact center focus limits generalizability
- **Time Window:** Analysis reflects snapshot, not longitudinal trends
