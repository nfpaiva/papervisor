  "title": "Intelligent call routing: optimizing contact center throughput",
  "authors": "AR Ali",
  "year": 2011,
  "doi": "10.1145/2237827.2237832",
  "abstract": "The data model is then loaded by the real-time or online decision system. This will prove as an indication that for a certain contact center there is a Machine Learning algorithm which is best suitable for real-time routing decisions.",
  "introduction": "Contact centers face increasing pressure to optimize throughput while maintaining service quality. Traditional routing algorithms use simple rules and static priorities, often resulting in suboptimal resource utilization. This paper presents an intelligent routing system that uses machine learning to make real-time routing decisions based on current system state and predicted outcomes.",
  "methods": "We propose a multi-criteria decision framework that incorporates agent skills, customer priority, expected handling time, and queue dynamics. The system uses supervised learning to predict call outcomes and reinforcement learning to optimize routing policies. Training data includes historical call records, agent performance metrics, and customer satisfaction scores.",
  "results": "Implementation in a production contact center with 200 agents shows 15% improvement in throughput, 22% reduction in average wait time, and 18% increase in first call resolution rate. The system adapts to changing conditions within 2-3 hours, significantly faster than manual policy adjustments.",
  "discussion": "The intelligent routing system demonstrates clear benefits over traditional approaches. Key success factors include comprehensive data collection, real-time model updating, and integration with existing contact center infrastructure. The approach is particularly effective during peak periods and unexpected demand spikes.",
  "conclusion": "Intelligent call routing using machine learning provides substantial operational benefits for contact centers. The approach is practical for real-world deployment and scales effectively with contact center size.",
