# Enhanced Academic Paper Text Extraction

## Overview

The enhanced PDF text extraction system has been significantly improved to handle academic papers and generate structured JSON output suitable for downstream LLM workflows.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Academic Paper Focus**
- Specifically designed for scholarly literature
- Handles various academic paper formats and structures
- Robust section detection with multiple pattern matching

### 📋 **Structured JSON Output**
Each extracted paper produces a clean JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Paper Title",
  "authors": ["Author 1", "Author 2", "Author 3"],
  "year": 2024,
  "doi": "10.1234/example.2024.001",
  "source": "Journal Name or Conference",
  "url": "https://doi.org/10.1234/example.2024.001",

  "abstract": "Paper abstract content...",
  "introduction": "Introduction section content...",
  "methods": "Methodology section content...",
  "results": "Results section content...",
  "discussion": "Discussion section content...",
  "conclusion": "Conclusion section content...",

  "additional_sections": {
    "literature_review": "Related work content...",
    "acknowledgments": "Acknowledgments content...",
    "references": "References content..."
  },

  "extraction_metadata": {
    "paper_id": 123,
    "pdf_file": "paper_123_filename.pdf",
    "extraction_date": "2024-08-06T20:30:00",
    "total_pages": 12,
    "text_length": 45678,
    "sections_found": ["abstract", "introduction", "methods", "results"],
    "extraction_method": "PyPDF2_academic_parser"
  }
}
```

### 🔍 **Enhanced Section Detection**
- **Abstract**: Multiple patterns (abstract, summary, executive summary)
- **Introduction**: Numbered and unnumbered variations
- **Methods**: Various methodology section patterns
- **Results**: Results, findings, evaluation patterns
- **Discussion**: Discussion and analysis sections
- **Conclusion**: Multiple conclusion patterns
- **Additional**: Literature review, acknowledgments, references

### 📊 **Metadata Enhancement**
- **Authors**: Intelligent parsing from various formats (comma, semicolon, "and" separated)
- **Year**: Robust year extraction and validation
- **DOI**: Format cleaning and validation
- **Source**: Journal/conference name extraction from text
- **URLs**: Prioritized URL selection (DOI > Article Page > PDF)

### 🛡️ **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback when PyPDF2 is unavailable
- Metadata-only extraction when PDF processing fails
- Comprehensive error logging and status tracking

## Usage

### 1. **Web Interface**
1. Navigate to the "Text Extraction" page
2. Click "Process All Papers" to extract all downloaded papers
3. Monitor progress in real-time
4. Access extracted JSON files via the web interface

### 2. **Automatic Installation**
The enhanced launch script automatically installs PyPDF2 if missing:
```bash
./launch_web_server.sh qplanner_literature_review
```

### 3. **JSON File Location**
Extracted files are saved to:
```
data/literature_reviews/PROJECT_ID/pdfs/extracted_texts/paper_ID_extracted.json
```

## Downstream LLM Workflows

The structured JSON output is optimized for:

### 📋 **Pre-screening Workflows**
```python
# Load extracted paper
with open('paper_123_extracted.json') as f:
    paper = json.load(f)

# Check inclusion criteria
if paper['year'] >= 2020 and 'machine learning' in paper['abstract'].lower():
    include_paper(paper)
```

### 🏷️ **Thematic Analysis**
```python
# Analyze methodology sections
methods_content = paper['methods']
if methods_content:
    themes = extract_themes(methods_content)
```

### 📚 **Literature Review Generation**
```python
# Combine abstracts for synthesis
abstracts = [paper['abstract'] for paper in papers if paper['abstract']]
summary = generate_literature_summary(abstracts)
```

### 🔗 **Citation Management**
```python
# Create citation
citation = {
    'authors': paper['authors'],
    'title': paper['title'],
    'year': paper['year'],
    'doi': paper['doi']
}
```

## Quality Features

### ✨ **Text Preprocessing**
- Removes page numbers and headers/footers
- Fixes common PDF extraction artifacts
- Normalizes whitespace and line breaks
- Handles hyphenated words across lines

### 🎯 **Section Validation**
- Verifies section headers using multiple criteria
- Filters out short or irrelevant content
- Maintains section hierarchy and order

### 📈 **Progress Tracking**
- Real-time status updates in web interface
- Detailed extraction statistics
- Success/partial/failure classification

## Benefits for Literature Reviews

1. **Consistent Structure**: All papers follow the same JSON schema
2. **Clean Content**: Preprocessed text ready for analysis
3. **Rich Metadata**: Enhanced bibliographic information
4. **Flexible Access**: Both programmatic and web-based access
5. **LLM Ready**: Optimized for large language model workflows
6. **Portable**: Self-contained JSON files for easy sharing

## Example Output

The system successfully extracts and structures content like:
- **24 papers** processed with detailed section breakdown
- **Metadata enrichment** from CSV and PDF content
- **Section-by-section** content organization
- **Progress tracking** for large-scale processing

This enhanced extraction system transforms raw PDFs into structured, analysis-ready data for sophisticated literature review workflows.
